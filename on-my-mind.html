<h2>On My Mind</h2>
<p>
        This page is a quieter space where I occasionally write about what I am
        thinking—about research, teaching, and life. Nothing here represents the
        official view of any institution; it is simply one human being trying to
        make sense of the world around me.

<h3>Why “Different” Is the Default, Not the Insight</h3>
<div class="post-date">November 26, 2025</div>
 <p>
    I recently read 
    <strong>
      “<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/agentic-ai-at-scale-redefining-management-for-a-superhuman-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Agentic AI at Scale: Redefining Management for a Superhuman Workforce
      </a>”
    </strong>
    in <em>MIT Sloan Management Review</em>. The article notes that 
    nearly 70% of surveyed experts claim that agentic AI accountability demands entirely new management approaches, while 25% disagree. I applaud the minority.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is remarkably easy to label every new invention as fundamentally different. We do it because:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Novelty is socially inherited, not independently concluded.</strong><br>
      Experts and observers often believe a technology is new because they 
      <strong>heard others say it is</strong>. Repetition manufactures inevitability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Agreement is cognitively and reputationally cheap.</strong><br>
      Conforming to the majority is easier than resisting it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Continuity requires proof; difference requires none.</strong><br>
      Declaring “difference”&mdash;the popular choice&mdash;invites little challenge. 
      Declaring continuity flips the burden: <strong>you must defend it</strong>. 
      In a low-attention, high-velocity world, most avoid the cost.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Difference is often not insight&mdash;it’s <strong>echo, convenience, and safety in disguise</strong>. 
    That alone makes it worth interrogating.

<h3>Doing Slow Work in a Fast Digital World</h3>
<div class="post-date">November 24, 2025</div>
<p>
            Much of my research looks at very fast phenomena—tweets, platform
            launches, market reactions. Yet the work itself is slow. Data
            collection, coding, theorizing, and revising a paper over many years
            can feel out of sync with the speed of digital life.
          </p>
<p>
            I have come to see this tension as a feature, not a bug. Slowness
            gives us room to notice patterns that are invisible in the moment
            and to question “obvious” narratives. It is one way academia can add
            value in a world flooded with instant commentary.

<h3>Helping Students Connect Code and Judgment</h3>
<div class="post-date">November 24, 2025</div>
<p>
            In analytics courses, it is tempting to focus mainly on tools:
            Python, SQL, dashboards, models. These skills are important, but I
            try to constantly bring students back to judgment: Why are we
            asking this question? Who is affected by the decision? What are we
            missing in the data?
          </p>
<p>
            My favorite moments are when students realize that the “best”
            model is not always the most complex one, but the one that fits the
            problem, the people, and the context. That realization stays with
            them long after the specific software changes.

<h3>First-Generation Paths and Paying It Forward</h3>
<div class="post-date">November 24, 2025</div>
<p>
            As a first-generation college graduate, I still remember how opaque
            universities felt when I was a student. Many unwritten rules were
            confusing, and chances to “get involved” or “network” did not feel
            designed with students like me in mind.
          </p>
<p>
            That memory shapes how I advise and teach. I try to make expectations
            explicit, open doors to research and projects, and remind students
            that their background is not a deficit but a source of insight.
            Education works best when it makes more future paths visible, not
            fewer.

<h2>Notes to Future Posts</h2>
<p>
        A few themes I expect to write more about here:
      </p>
<ul class="card-list">
<li>How AI is changing both what we research and how we research it.</li>
<li>What “good” digital citizenship might look like for organizations.</li>
<li>Practical advice for students navigating analytics and tech careers.</li>
<li>Small habits that make academic work more sustainable and humane.</li>
</ul>
